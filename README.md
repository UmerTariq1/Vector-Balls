## üéØ How to Play

### Starting the Game

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Setup Screen**: Configure your game settings:
   - Number of balls (2-12)
   - Lines added per boundary hit (1-10)
   - Ball-ball collision speed increase factor
   - Boundary collision speed increase
   - Arena size percentage (30-100%)
   - Select unique colors for each ball

3. Click "Start" to begin gameplay

### Controls

#### During Gameplay
- **Spacebar**: Pause/Resume gameplay anytime
- **ESC**: Show quit confirmation dialog (returns to menu if confirmed)
- **R**: Return to setup menu (only when game is over)

#### Setup Menu
- **Mouse**: Click settings, color picker, Start/Exit buttons
- **ESC**: Exit the application
- **Enter**: Confirm selections

#### Stats Screen
- **R**: Return to setup menu
- **Mouse**: Click Exit Game button to quit application

### Gameplay Mechanics

#### Ball Movement
- Balls move continuously within the circular arena
- Physics-based collisions with realistic bouncing

#### Line System
- Each ball starts with 3 lines anchored to random boundary points
- Lines grow and shrink as balls move
- Lines cannot be interacted with by their own ball

#### Grace Period
- First 1 second of gameplay: No lines can be removed (safety period)
- Visual countdown shows remaining time: "Peace time remaining: 0.8s"
- Allows players to get oriented and positioned before competitive phase begins

#### Interactions
- **Ball-Ball Collision**: Balls bounce off each other with increased speed
- **Ball-Boundary Collision**: Balls bounce off the arena wall and gain new lines
- **Ball-Line Collision**: Touching another ball's line removes that line permanently

#### Color Assignment
- 12 distinct colors available: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, Orange, Purple, Gold, Hot Pink, Navy Blue, Dark Magenta
- Automatic random assignment ensures each ball gets a unique, easily distinguishable color
- Colors are optimized for maximum visual distinction

#### Victory Conditions
- A ball is eliminated when all its lines are removed
- Last remaining ball wins
- Game continues until only one ball remains

### Strategy Tips

- **Offensive Play**: Position yourself to intersect opponents' lines
- **Defensive Play**: Avoid letting opponents get near your lines
- **Boundary Usage**: Use boundary bounces to gain new lines strategically
- **Speed Management**: Faster balls can cover more ground but are harder to control

GRACE_PERIOD_DURATION = 1.0
INITIAL_SPEED_MIN = 160.0
INITIAL_SPEED_MAX = 240.0
```

### UI Customization

## üéÆ Tips & Strategies

### Beginner Tips
- Use the grace period to position yourself advantageously
- Stay near the boundary to gain lines quickly
- Watch for balls approaching your lines from behind

### Advanced Strategies
- Time your boundary bounces to create line barriers
- Use speed boosts strategically for quick maneuvers
- Position yourself to intercept multiple opponents' lines simultaneously

### Performance Notes
- Optimal performance with 2-8 balls
- Higher ball counts (9-12) may require more powerful hardware
- 60 FPS gameplay for smooth physics simulation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Emojis not showing**: Some systems may not display emoji characters in game text
- **Color similarity**: If colors appear too similar, they can be manually reselected in setup
- **Performance issues**: Reduce ball count or arena size for better performance
